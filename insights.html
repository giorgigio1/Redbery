        <h2>Redberrian Insights</h2>
        <p>We were soo much fun before the pandemic started! Parties almost every 
            weekend and lavish employee birthday celebrations! Unfortunately, 
            covid ruined that fun like it did almost everything else in the world. 
            But we try our best to zhuzh it up a bit. For example, we host biweekly 
            Devtalks where our senior and lead developers talk about topics they are 
            passionate about. Previous topics have included Web3, NFT, Laravel 9, 
            Kubernetes, etc. We hold these talks in the office but you can join our 
            Zoom broadcast as well. Feel free to join either as an attendee or a speaker!
